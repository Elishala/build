-open terminal
-enter 'ls' for a list of your directory
-change directory into the folder you want to create an app into, like this, 'cd src'
-make directory, then the name of the folder to create, 'mkdir build'
-'cd' into that new folder name, like so, 'cd build'
-then open atom, 'build atom' (or open whatever text editor you're using)
-next create a 'README.md', put your notes for others to read in here
-then make an html file, a css file, & a js file
-once in the html file, type HTML5, then hit tab, for auto tags (if you have these packages set up.)


-files we need next: .gitignore, gulp, package.json, node ... i think. and are there others?
-eventually you might want a css folder, where all of your css/scss files belong. you could have a file for colors & fonts, those can go in the css file too. you might also want a folder for all js files.

-what am i forgetting? and what order do the items in line 12 go in?
